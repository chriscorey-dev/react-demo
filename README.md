# Hello

This project is made with react and bootstrap so far. Just getting my bearings with react.

## Site contents

At the moment it has some basic HTML, CSS, bootstrap, and react features. Some day it may be the beginnings of a project or portfolio type page.

## Git lifecycle

When committed and pushed, this site is pushed to my server and automatically built and hosted at https://react.chris-corey.com. The repo is then mirrored and pushed to github.
