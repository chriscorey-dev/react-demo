# Hello

This project is made with react and bootstrap so far. Just getting my bearings with react.

## Git lifecycle

When committed and pushed, this site is pushed to my server and automatically checked out and hosted at http://react.chris-corey.com. The repo is then mirrored and pushed to github.
