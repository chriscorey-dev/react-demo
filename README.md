# Hello

This project is made with react and bootstrap so far. Just getting my bearings with react.

## Site contents

### Technologies:

- React
- Bootstrap
- ~~Ajax~~
- .fetch API
- RESTful API

At the moment it has some basic HTML, CSS, bootstrap, and react features. Some day it may be the beginnings of a project or portfolio type page.

## Git lifecycle

When committed and pushed, this site is pushed to my server and automatically built and hosted at https://react.chris-corey.com. The repo is then mirrored and pushed to github.

## Things I plan on doing

- API endopoint talking to database (RESTful CRUD API)
  - Learn about fetch credentials.
  - Learn HTTML crud interaction with apis.
- Login system cuz why not
  - In react
  - Figure out password storage and management
  - Mo security
